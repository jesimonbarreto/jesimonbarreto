### Repositories
In my github you will find projects developed during my professional career. These projects are divided into research projects, practical assignments, course projects and small projects.

- #### Research Projects
They are codes and files referring to developed research. The TTAirManager and Control-Equipment repositories are examples of research projects.
- #### Practical Work
These are codes developed from the teachers' proposal based on the course content. The AlgoritmoEstruturaDados, MachineLearning, SistemasNebuloso and TeoriaDecis√£o repositories are examples of practical work.
- #### Courses Projects
They are documents and codes referring to projects developed throughout a curricular component of the university. The repositories LabPojeto2, TeleoperatedCrane, Sensors_lab4 are examples of course projects.
- #### Small Projects
They are codes developed for a small solution, often developed to solve a specific problem for data annotation.

### Themes and Topics
The themes of the projects are directly related to my academic trajectory. Thus, the contents are directly related to the following topics:
- Computer networks (2011 - 2014);
- Human computer interaction (Touching Air Research Group: 2012 - 2016);
- Systems engineering (bachelor degree: 2016 - Present);
- Pattern recognition, machine learning, deep learning, digital image processing, wearable motion sensor signals (Smart Sense Laboratory: 2016 - Present)
