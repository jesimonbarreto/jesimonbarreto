### Repositories
In my github you will find projects developed by me or that I am involved in during my professional career. These projects are divided into research projects, practical assignments, course projects and small projects.

- #### Research Projects
They are codes and files referring to developed research. The TTAirManager and Control-Equipment repositories, research projects carried out between the years 2012 - 2014, are examples of research projects.
- #### Practical Works
These are codes developed from the teachers' proposal based on the course content. The ICV, MachineLearning, SistemasNebuloso and TeoriaDecis√£o repositories are examples of practical work.
- #### Courses Projects
They are documents and codes referring to projects developed throughout a curricular component of the university. The repositories LabPojeto2, LabProjeto3, LabProjeto4 are examples of course projects.
- #### Small Projects
They are codes developed for a small solution, often developed to solve a specific problem for data annotation.

### Themes and Topics
The themes of the projects are directly related to my academic trajectory. In this way, the contents are directly related to the following topics:
- Computer networks ( 2011 to 2014);
- Human computer interaction (Touching Air Research Group - 2012 to 2016);
- Systems engineering (Graduation - 2016 - Present);
- Pattern recognition, machine learning, deep learning, digital image processing, wearable motion sensor signals (Smart Sense Laboratory - 2016 - Present)
